# Deep-Learning-I
First lectures of Deep Learning I
</br>
There are 3 key parts :

- **Multi-layer Perceptron** (MLP / Deep Neural Network) :
  - Coded from scratch
  - With Pytorch
- **RNN** :
  - RNN and LSTM to classify reviews
  - LSTM to generate new sequences of music
- **CNN** :
  - CNN to classify images
  - Weakness of CNNs with Advesarial examples
